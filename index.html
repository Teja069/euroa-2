          <h5 class="card-title">Which one is the most basic programming language to learn, and why is that?
        </h5>
          <p class="card-text">The most basic is BASIC. But it’s not very useful these days, it’s kind of obsolete.
            The most useful is C, it is very closely related to systems and thus forces you to learn computer systems.
            The most straightforward is PHP, although most tutorials out there are focused on Web programming requiring you to learn what Web is first!
            The most complete is Python. It has huge amount of libraries and vast uses. It also has a delightful specification and syntax.
            The most used yet annoying is Javascript. It’s just…. Javascript.
            The most popular is Java. The relationship between Java and Javascript is like Car and Carpet. That means none. All old programmers know Java.
            The most Windowsi is C#. It kind of forces you to live a Windows life.
            The one with the most functional is Haskell or Scheme or Erlang or Scala. It’s useful if you wanna program airplanes or boast to your friends with PhD who don’t really know how to code.The most weird is Ruby. Lots of fanboys but no practical use.
            The most common is C++. It is definitely not C, and you definitely don’t need to learn it. Unless you’re learning Object Oriented concepts in college.
            The most Applei is Swift. You kind of need to learn it if you wanna create apps for iSomething.
            The most reliable yet useful is Go. It’s C++ on steroids but more like C and without the baggage.
            The most statistical is R. It’s used for statistics and data analysis.
            The most weird is Perl. It’s BASH on steroids and was created by aliens.
            The most Googli is Kotlin. It’s All the crap from Java combined with all the crap from Android, and a ton of crap added on top.
            The most rusty is Rust. If C++ is overrated, Rust is overrated++.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Which is the best data Science course for Enginners?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">I see that most of the aspiring Data Science and AI professionals fail to understand that a fancy certificate from any institute will not help you land a job in Data Science or AI.

                What does an Interviewer of Data Science or AI role looks for:
                
                Relevant work Data Science or AI experience from your previous company.
                
                If not, have done any real or live projects with any company (through an unpaid internship).
                
                The intent out here is to shortlist those candidates in the interview who worked on real-time data, not dummy project or data.
                
                Therefore, Skillslash provides real-time projects from reputable companies where students and learners get the opportunity to work on it and get hands-on experience.
                
                Furthermore, Certificates will be provided by the companies. The work experience collected from these projects therefore, helps the student receive a placement on their performance and produce. So to speak, SkillSlash offers Job guarantee and if this is not the kick-start to your career in Data Science, what is?
                
                Now why people don’t get shortlisting's from companies after doing any Data Science or AI course ?</p>
